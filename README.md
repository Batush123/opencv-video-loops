# opencv-video-loops

Video processing and display loops developed at the [Cornell Tech
Connected Experiences Laboratory](http://cx.jacobs.cornell.edu/).

Code by Doron Tal (2018) for a project with 
Benedetta Piantella and [Mor
Naaman](https://people.jacobs.cornell.edu/mor/) at the Cornell
Tech [Connected Experiences
Laboratory](http://cx.jacobs.cornell.edu/). The work of the lab is generously supported by

## Introduction

The code in this repository provides a Python code framework for using OpenCV with streaming video. It includes an abstract base class that runs the video grabbing and OpenCV processing in separate threads, and several examples of video processing that use that class.
